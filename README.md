## Credit and license
This project was created primarly using the [GitHub Pages gem for Jekyll](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) and a slightly modified [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). It is licensed under [The Unlicense](https://github.com/pglevy/plain-vanilla-gh-pages/blob/main/LICENSE), which allows everything and promises nothing. ðŸ˜Ž
