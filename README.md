# About Mannerly-mail
The purpose of this project is encourage good email composition etiquette by giving people a guided, opinionated experience for drafting emails.

Includes the following:
- Prompts that make senders think
- Help for how to answer prompts
- Sections to focus what type of content is needed
- Template that results in emails with 5 sentences or less (unless you cheat!)

## How it works
Using [this Zap from Zapier](https://zapier.com/shared/514e263ecf5dd8b7198baf3508ce183c260773ba) to take responses from a Google Form (which saves to a Sheet) and compose a draft email with the content, including some minimal formatting.

## GitHub template
This repo is based on the Plain-Vanilla GitHub Pages template. I just changed the site title in the config file, some copy in the index.md file, and pasted in the embed code of the Google Form.

### Copying the template and setting up publishing
1. Press the `Use this template` button on the `Code` tab.
1. Go to the `Settings` tab and then go to the `Pages` settings.
1. Set the `Source` to `main` and press `Save`.

You'll see a URL show up, but the site takes a few minutes before it's actually live. In the meantime, try creating a page.

## Credit and license
This project was created primarly using the [GitHub Pages gem for Jekyll](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) and a slightly modified [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). It is licensed under [The Unlicense](https://github.com/pglevy/plain-vanilla-gh-pages/blob/main/LICENSE), which allows everything and promises nothing. ðŸ˜Ž
